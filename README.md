Language Tutor:
A current solution is a language tutor that drills via using TTS and Whisper to provide a phrase in a language (French currently), 
and then get the user to repeat it back. The script figures out what it thought was said and provide a comparison. The current version
uses a CSV configuration file as a seed for phrases. 

This builds on https://github.com/maudoin/ollama-voice and https://github.com/apeatling/ollama-voice-mac which provides end to end AI responses via audio.
